Problems with Autoencoders for generation purposes:

If we take a look at the plot of the learned representation following problems are visible:

-Plot isn't symmetrical around origin

-Some labels are represented over small areas while other labels are represented on large areas --> No diversity

-Gaps between coloured points --> Data will be generated poorly


How to solve problems?

USE VARIATIONAL AUTOENCODER (VAE)
