Audio Data:

Basic:
Produced by vibration of objects -- determines oscillation of air molecules
Waveform given by frequency and amplitude

How to get data?
- decompose complex sound into sum of sine Waves oscillating at different frequencies -- Fourier transform

Fourier Transform:
Conversion from time - Domain graph to frequency - Domain "Spectrum"
	- NO TIME INFORMATION (not good)

Usage of FT in Deep Learning:

Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT)
- Several FFT at different intervals
- Time information GIVEN
- Frame size fixed
- Spectrogram (time, frequency, magnitude) -- all relevant data for data set training
